## My process

### Built with

- Svelte & Vite
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

Getting a bit more familiar with layouts again, how to center properly etc.

I feel quite happy with the layout structure. Im not sure if the image overlay is the best solution.

I still struggly to make the text look the same as the design, any tips on this regards are appreciated.
